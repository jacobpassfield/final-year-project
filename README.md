Data analysis in fisheries science.

This is where the code used for my dissertation can be found.

The files: filtered-data, australia-map, whitefin-surgeonfish and every-species contain the code to
generate the analysis in the drafted report. These R scripts will be transformed into R Markdown files in due
course. The data and figures used in the report can be found in the appropriate folders.
