Data analysis in fisheries science.

The files: filtered-data, australia-map, pearly-wrasse-2 and every-sepecies-2 contain the code to
generate the analysis in the drafted report. These R scripts will be transformed into R Markdown files in due
course. The data and figures used in the report can be found in the appropriate folders.
